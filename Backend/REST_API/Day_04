An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other.
A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.
For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

Types of APIs other than REST are:

1. SOAP
2. JSON RPC and XML RPC

If a website is using REST API, its data will always be in JSON format.


For normal package transfer in APIs, TCP/IP is used i.e., for transporting data.
For live video streaming and voice calls RTP is used.
For web access http/https is used.
